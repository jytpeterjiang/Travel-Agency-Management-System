# Project

## Goal

Travel Agency Management System: A platform for managing travel bookings, itineraries, and customer information, complete with functionalities to add trips, browse packages, and record customer reviews.

## Requirements

### 1. System Scope

Your system should model a real-world scenario. The system should allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data entities (e.g., customers, products, transactions, etc.).

### 2. OOP Concepts

- Use at least one interface to define a set of methods that must be implemented by multiple classes.
- Use at least one abstract class to provide common functionality for related classes.
- Demonstrate inheritance by creating a hierarchy of classes (e.g., a base class and at least two subclasses).
- Use at least 6 interconnected classes.
- Use method overloading.
- Use method overriding.
- Use polymorphism to allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- Use Exception handling to handle error messages. There must be at least two user defined exception classes.

### 3. Data Storage

- Use file I/O to store and retrieve data persistently (e.g., save customer details, transaction history, or inventory to a file).
- The system should load data from a file when the program starts and save data back to the file when the program exits.
- You may also choose to use a database to store your data. No extra credit is provided in this case.

### 4. Data Structures

Use ArrayList or other Java Collections Framework classes to manage collections of objects (e.g., a list of customers, products, or orders). Therefore, a total amount of orders/deposits can be shown as a output on GUI.

### 5. GUI Requirements

- Implement a Java Swing GUI with a main window that allows users to interact with the system. The main window should include:
  - Input fields (e.g., text fields, dropdowns, buttons) for users to perform CRUD operations.
  - A display area (e.g., a JTextArea, JTable, or JList) to show output (e.g., error messages, lists of customers, transactions, or inventory, etc.).
- All primary functions should be operated within the main window. Temporary windows (e.g., dialog boxes) may be used for user input when necessary, but they must close immediately after serving their purpose.
- Ensure the GUI is user-friendly and intuitive (e.g., include labels, clear layouts, and error messages for invalid input).

### 6. Some features may make your project more attractive

- Implement sorting or searching functionality (e.g., sort customers by name, search for a product by ID).
- Add features to do data analysis according to the data the system collects.

### Proposal

Please Write a short proposal in a PDF file (2 - 3 pages) explaining:

- The real-world scenario you chose and the business logic for the scenario.
- Explain your design of the required OOP concepts (interface, abstract class, inheritance, etc.). You should give me UML diagram code to show your design.
- Draw your GUI window interface, and explain the features involved in the system.
You should give me UML diagram code to show your design.
- Explain how the IO is designed.
